# STIG_OVAL

This is a placeholder repo. No significant work has been done on this project yet.

<b>Roadmap:</b>

My pervious stig-checker project used an outdated approach to checking for stig-compliance, relying on manual checking of configuration files and system settings. The approach developed by Mitre and favored by the DoD involves using oval definitions from a database which contain information about the vulnerabilities that need to be addressed and the approach to solve them.

This repository will hold the code which uses this approach to verifying STIG compliance.
